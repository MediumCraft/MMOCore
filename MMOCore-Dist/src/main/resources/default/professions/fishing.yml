# Fishing drop tables which override MC default. When fishing, the plugin
# reads through all the drop tables and picks THE first one where all
# the conditions are met! You must first specify the drop tables which
# have the highest number of conditions (the most restrictive).
#
# Number of tugs = number of times you need to click to fish.
#
# If you remove this section, the fishing stat placeholders in the player
# stats GUI will stop working, as it is required for MMOCore to recognize
# this profession as the "Fishing" profession.
