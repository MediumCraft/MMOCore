# Experience tables are separated into multiple items.

example_exp_table:

  # Every item is fully independent and has its own chance
  # of dropping every time a player passes a level! When an
  # item drops, all its triggers are called.
  first_table_item:

    # This item will drop every 3 level ups
    period: 3

    # This item has a 80% chance to drop every 3 level ups
    chance: 80

    # Every successive drop failure the item will reduce the
    # future risk by X%. With a 80% failure reduction rate,
    # risks become:
    # - 80%
    # - 96% (almost guaranteed)
    # - 99.2% (almost guaranteed+)
    # - 99.84% (almost guaranteed++)
    # so on forever..
    #
    # This is better than just increasing the claim chance by a
    # certain amount each time because otherwise the claim chance
    # just becomes/surpasses 100% at some point.
